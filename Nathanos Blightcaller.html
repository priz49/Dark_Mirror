    <p>Nathanos Blightcaller (born Nathanos Marris) is the champion and bodyguard[3] of the Banshee Queen of the Forsaken, and a teacher of new Forsaken hunters. In life, Nathanos was the first and only human "ranger lord,"<br> trained by the high elves of Quel'Thalas, and was close to Sylvanas Windrunner. He died and became undead during the Third War, joining Sylvanas's rogue Forsaken shortly afterward. As Nathanos Blightcaller, he would<br> stand in the Eastern Plaguelands, battling the Alliance heroes sent to kill him and faking his death. Recently, his body was restored with the help of Sylvanas's val'kyr and now serves his liege with renewed strength.</p>
