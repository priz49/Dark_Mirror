    <p>Nathanos Marris closed his eyes and inhaled deeply through a nose that had been broken<br> more times than he could count. A hint of autumn hung in the still, humid air, mingling with<br> the aroma of wildflowers sprouting between the flagstones that marked the path. It was a<br> good scent. Familiar, earthy. One he was determined never to relinquish.</p>
